In html, all open tags must be closed. But there are some exceptions, such as <img src='http.....jpg'>

<!-- everything in between these is commented
-->

CSS = cascading style sheets
Best practice of putting the css link in the <head> section.</head>

in the .css file, you can point the code/class directly to the .html section by using the tag name
body or div or p or etc.

body {
	background: blue;
}
	or
a{
	color: white; <!-- can also use hex coloring #4CAF50 -->
}
	or
p {
	text-decoration: underline;
}

CLASS: use to target specific not html named tags. Always start with a '.' in the .css file.
.something {
	background: pink;
}
The html file will point to it directly
<p class="something">blah blah/p>
or
<div class="first-div">blah blah</div>
in css file 
.first-div {
	font-size: 28px;
}
	This will set the entire <div section to that font size. But you can then change the <p sections and they will change to what you have set in the <p because its the "lowest" cascade (more specific to that section)

ID uses the # sign....allows you to target css classes more
<div class="first-div" id="id-2">
#id-2 {
	something: 50%
}
</div>

width: 123px
height: 50% or 200px

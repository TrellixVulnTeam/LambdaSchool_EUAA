Bootstrap

Most .html files have the following as a standard template
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head> <title>title</title>	</head>
	<body> </body>
</html>

"navbar" class is normally the top main bar across the top of the screen that will have like navigation buttons, a background image, links, etc.
	is created in css file i.e. .navbar  and is associated in html file by <div class="navbar">

margin = puts space around the outside of the container. i.e margin: 10px; would put a 10pix space around the div container
padding = puts space around the inside of the container border. padding: 10px; would put a 10px space on the inside of the container
float = is kind of like telling the container which side to start from.
	float: right; means that the div container would be on the right side of the screen, and the second container would be next to that.
	float: left; means the div would start on the left side of the screen.
	Use float to list containers on the same horizontal line instead of vertical

Once you install the bootstrap css in the html page, you can add the bootstrap css functions to your css file as needed.
Put the bootstrap link in the <head> tag
You can install bootstrap on the server, or use a CDN link which links to the bootstrap site and loads it from there dynamically. 
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://......." 
If using bootstrap css and you want to change a setting, you create a custom css file and use the same class name but with the different setting, such as border or color.
Can have multiple links to different css files in the header.

Can utilize multiple classes per container. i.e. <div class="one two three">

-Week 2 / Lesson 1-

Didn't watch video. Homework was mostly github and then using chrome inspector to open a tweet and then change the text. Screen shot that and upload it.

Video also covered command line information.

Fork repository
clone it to local system
edit readme.md
push it back to repo

git log will show you the log of commits on repo

Use Chrome Inspect to see elements of a web page. Very very useful.
